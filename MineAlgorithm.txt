Random
------
Shuffle function of the collections library is used to achive random maps of mines.
An arraylist containing the id/numbers representing each postion is created. The 
arraylist is then shuffled using the shuffle fuctions of collections library. After 
shuffleing the first n numbers are picked as the location id to place the mines.
n is decided based on the user's choice of difficulty.The process is more efficient 
in generating unique random values, since using random will have a lot of unwanted 
iteration on already used number. The number of unwanted iterations is directly
proportional to the ratio of data to space. The unwanted iterations are avoided by
using shuffle.
